Ideas

- Bonus after a match has been made to tell all their freinds
- Find unfair advantage, could be direct access to JLL brokers
	- Show app to current customers and ask if they would have used it
	- Send photo of agent

- Get lots of user feedback after each match, iteration etc

- Marketing: reach out to people leasing space to see if they'll promote the app
