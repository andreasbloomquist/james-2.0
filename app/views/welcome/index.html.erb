        <p class="faq-q">Is it free?</p>
        <p class="faq-a">Yep! The service James offers is completely free. It's James’ goal to provide you with a fast, confidential, and personalized service for finding your next office space. Please note that standard text messaging and data rates may apply per your wireless carriers terms of service.</p>
        <p class="faq-q">Who are the brokers behind James?</p>
        <p class="faq-a">James is currently in beta with a small team of amazing hand-picked top-producing brokers in San Francisco. We aim to grow the list of brokers in the future to ensure that James’ algorithms match you with the right broker and the right space in the right market. Rest assured brokers James works with will always be hand selected, and by invite only.</p>
        <p class="faq-q">Where is James available?</p>
        <p class="faq-a">James is currently only available in San Francisco.</p>
        <p class="faq-q">Am I committed to talk to a broker?</p>
        <p class="faq-a">Think of James as your personal office search concierge. He’ll show you what brokers have confirmed is available, give you all the details, all the while keeping your information anonymous. It's completely up to you if you want to talk directly to the broker who submitted a space, much less set up a tour.</p>
        <p class="faq-q">Can I schedule a tour?</p>
        <p class="faq-a">Once you find the perfect office space, James will help facilitate scheduling a tour with the broker. After checking the broker’s schedule, James will send you a follow up text with a few 30 minute time slots. Simply reply with the time that works for you, and James will take care of the rest and even put it on your calendars!</p>
